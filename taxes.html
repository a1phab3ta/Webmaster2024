            <center><h1>Tax Rebates for Homeowners Using Renewable Energy</h1></center><br>
            <p>Many governments offer tax incentives and rebates to homeowners who install renewable energy systems such as solar panels, wind turbines, and geothermal heat pumps. These incentives vary depending on the location and the type of renewable energy system installed.</p> <br>
            <p>Here are some common types of tax incentives and rebates for renewable energy:</p>
            <ul class = tips-list>
                <li>Federal Investment Tax Credit (ITC): Provides a tax credit of up to 26% of the cost of installing a solar energy system for residential properties.</li>
                <li>State and local rebates: Many states and local governments offer additional rebates or incentives for installing renewable energy systems.</li>
                <li>Property tax exemptions: Some jurisdictions offer property tax exemptions for renewable energy systems, reducing the property tax burden for homeowners.</li>
                <li>Net metering: Allows homeowners to sell excess electricity generated by their renewable energy systems back to the grid, offsetting their electricity bills.</li>
            </ul> <br>
            <p>It's important to research and understand the available tax incentives and rebates in your area before investing in renewable energy systems for your home.</p>
