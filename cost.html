      <center><h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Renewable energy sources offer an excellent opportunity for individuals to save costs on energy spending while contributing to environmental sustainability. This webpage explores various ways individuals can leverage renewable energy to reduce their energy bills.</p>
 
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <section class="content-section">
      <center><h2>1. Wind Power</h2></center>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Wind power, generated by harnessing the kinetic energy of wind, offers significant cost-saving benefits:</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <ul class='tips-list'>
        <li><strong>Low Operating Costs:</strong> Once wind turbines are installed, operating costs are relatively low compared to fossil fuel-based power plants, as wind is a free and renewable resource.</li>
        <li><strong>Rapid Deployment and Scalability:</strong> Wind projects can be deployed relatively quickly and can be scaled up or down to meet energy demand, providing flexibility and cost-saving opportunities.</li>
        <li><strong>Fixed Energy Costs:</strong> Wind power contracts often include fixed energy prices over the long term, protecting consumers from volatile fuel prices and providing stability in energy costs.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
    </section>

    <section class="content-section">
      <center><h2>2. Solar Power</h2></center>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Solar power, generated by converting sunlight into electricity using photovoltaic cells, also offers potential cost-saving opportunities:</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <ul class='tips-list'>
        <li><strong>Decreasing Costs:</strong> The cost of solar photovoltaic (PV) panels has been steadily declining in recent years, making solar power increasingly cost-competitive with traditional energy sources.</li>
        <li><strong>Net Metering:</strong> Many jurisdictions offer net metering programs, allowing solar panel owners to sell excess electricity back to the grid at retail rates, effectively reducing or offsetting their electricity bills.</li>
        <li><strong>Long Lifespan and Low Maintenance:</strong> Solar PV systems have long operational lifespans (typically 25 years or more) and require minimal maintenance, resulting in lower operating costs and long-term cost savings.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
    </section>

    <section class="content-section">
      <center><h2>3. Hydropower</h2></center>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Hydropower, generated by harnessing the energy of flowing water, offers significant cost-saving benefits:</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <ul class='tips-list'>
        <li><strong>Low Operating Costs:</strong> Once a hydroelectric facility is built, operating costs are relatively low compared to fossil fuel-based power plants, as water is a free and renewable resource.</li>
        <li><strong>Long Lifespan:</strong> Hydroelectric plants have long operational lifespans, often exceeding 50 years with proper maintenance, allowing for consistent energy production and cost savings over time.</li>
        <li><strong>Energy Storage:</strong> Some hydroelectric facilities incorporate reservoirs for energy storage, enabling grid operators to store excess electricity during periods of low demand and release it during peak demand, thereby optimizing energy use and reducing costs.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
    </section>

    <section class="content-section">
      <center><h2>4. Nuclear Energy</h2></center>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Nuclear energy, derived from nuclear fission reactions, also offers potential cost-saving opportunities:</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <ul class='tips-list'>
        <li><strong>High Energy Density:</strong> Nuclear fuel possesses high energy density, meaning a small amount of fuel can produce a large amount of electricity, resulting in cost savings over the long term.</li>
        <li><strong>Stable Fuel Costs:</strong> Unlike fossil fuels, which are subject to price volatility, nuclear fuel costs are relatively stable, providing predictability for energy planning and budgeting.</li>
        <li><strong>Carbon-Free Electricity:</strong> Nuclear power plants produce electricity without emitting greenhouse gases, helping to mitigate climate change and potentially avoiding future costs associated with carbon pricing or emissions regulations.</li>
      </ul>

    <h1 style="color: white;">How to Use the Savings Calculator</h1>
    <div class="instructions">
      <p>Input your last month's consumption of energy in kWh and the money spent on energy, then select the type of energy source you would like to switch to.</p>
      <p>The calculator will determine how much money you will save from this switch each month.</p>
